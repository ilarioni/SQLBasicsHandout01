    <h1>SQL Tutorial</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.</p>
    <p>Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.</p>

    <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.</p>

    <p>What is SQL?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language</li>
        <li>SQL lets you access and manipulate databases</li>
        <li>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What Can SQL do?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL can execute queries against a database</li>
        <li>SQL can retrieve data from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can insert records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can update records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can delete records from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create new databases</li>
        <li>SQL can create new tables in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create views in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h3>
    <p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
    <p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>

    <p>Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>

    <h3>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h3>

    <p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)</li>
        <li>To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP</li>
        <li>To use SQL to get the data you want</li>
        <li>To use HTML / CSS to style the page</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>RDBMS</h3>
    <p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.</p>
    <p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.</p>
    <p>The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.</p>

    <p>Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. </p>
    <p>A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.</p>
    <p>A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.</p>


    <h1>SQL Syntax</h1>
    <h3>Database Tables</h3>

    <p>A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data.</p>
    <p>In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database (included in MS Access and MS SQL Server).</p>
    <p>The table above contains five records (one for each customer) and seven columns (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, and Country).</p>

    <h3>SQL Statements</h3>
    <p>Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the records in the "Customers" table:</p>

    <p>SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT</p>

    <h3>Semicolon after SQL Statements?</h3>
    <p>Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.</p>
    <p>Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.</p>

    <h3>Some of The Most Important SQL Commands</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT - extracts data from a database</li>
        <li>UPDATE - updates data in a database</li>
        <li>DELETE - deletes data from a database</li>
        <li>INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database</li>
        <li>CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database</li>
        <li>ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database</li>
        <li>CREATE TABLE - creates a new table</li>
        <li>ALTER TABLE - modifies a table</li>
        <li>DROP TABLE - deletes a table</li>
        <li>CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)</li>
        <li>DROP INDEX - deletes an index</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL SELECT Statement</h1>
    <p>The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.</p>
    <p>The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.</p>
    <p>SELECT Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM table_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects the "CustomerName" and "City" columns from the "Customers" table:</p>
    <p>SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;</p>
    or
    <p>SELECT CustomerName,City,ContactName FROM Customers;</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the columns from the "Customers" table:</p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM Customers;</p>

    <h1>SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement</h1>
    <p>The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.</p>
    <p>Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.</p>

    <p>syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;  -- result is 21</p>
    <p>SELECT Country FROM Customers;  -- result is 91</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:</p>
    <p>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers; ---  result is 1 and 21 items inside</p>

    <p><strong>Note: The example above will not work in Firefox! Because COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) is not supported in Microsoft Access databases. Firefox is using Microsoft Access in our examples.</strong></p>

    <p>Here is the workaround for MS Access:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries</li>
        <li>FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL WHERE Clause</h1>

    <p>The WHERE clause is used to filter records.</p>
    <p>It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.</p>

    <p>WHERE Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Mexico';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>above mentioned statement selects all records where in country column there is mentioned Mexico  - 5 Records </p>

    <h3>Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields</h3>

    <p>SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).</p>
    <p>However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerID=1;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operators in The WHERE Clause</h3>
    <p>The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>=	Equal</li>
        <li>>	Greater than</li>
        <li> <span>"<"</span>	Less than</li>
        <li>>=	Greater than or equal</li>
        <li><=	Less than or equal</li>
        <li><>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=</li>
        <li>BETWEEN	Between a certain range</li>
        <li>LIKE	Search for a pattern</li>
        <li>IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators</h1>
    <p>The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.</p>

    <p>The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.</li>
        <li>The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.</p>

    <h2>AND Syntax</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>OR Syntax</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>NOT Syntax</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE NOT condition;</li>
    </ul>


    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city is "Berlin":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where city is "Berlin" OR "München":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" OR "Spain":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany' OR Country='Spain';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE NOT Country='Germany';</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Combining AND, OR and NOT</h2>
    <p>You can also combine the AND, OR and NOT operators.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city must be "Berlin" OR "München" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany" and NOT "USA":</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL ORDER BY Keyword</h1>

    <p>The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.</p>
    <p>The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" column:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country;</li>
    </ul>

    or

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY City;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ORDER BY DESC Example</h2>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted DESCENDING by the "Country" column:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    or 

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY CustomerID DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ORDER BY Several Columns Example</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column.</p>
    <p>This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ORDER BY Several Columns Example 2</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and descending by the "CustomerName" column:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL INSERT INTO Statement</h1>
    <p>The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.</p>

    <p>INSERT INTO Syntax</p>
    <p>it is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:</li>
        <li> If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query.
            However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement inserts a new record in the "Customers" table:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)</li>
        <li>VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway');</li>
    </ul>

    <p>customers table has one more data injected in the table</p>
    <p>Did you notice that we did not insert any number into the CustomerID field?</p>
    <p>The CustomerID column is an auto-increment field and will be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into the table.</p>

    <h3>Insert Data Only in Specified Columns</h3>
    <p>It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)</li>
        <li>VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL NULL Values</h1>
    <p>A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.</p>
    <p>If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field.</p>
    <p>Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!</strong></p>

    <h3>How to Test for NULL Values?</h3>
    <p>It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.</p>
    <p>We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.</p>

    <h3>IS NULL Syntax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_names</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE column_name IS NULL;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>IS NOT NULL Syntax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_names</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>The IS NULL Operator</h3>
    <p>The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).</p>
    <p>The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Address IS NULL;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.</strong></p>

    <h3>The IS NOT NULL Operator</h3>
    <p>The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).</p>
    <p>the following SQL lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>it gives filled data back</strong></p>


    <h1>The SQL UPDATE Statement</h1>

    <p>The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.</p>
    <p>UPDATE Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UPDATE table_name</li>
        <li>SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement.</p>
    <p>The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!</p>

    <p>example</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UPDATE Customers</li>
        <li>SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt'</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerID=1;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>UPDATE Multiple Records</h3>

    <p>It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement will update the ContactName to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":</p>

    <ul>
        <li>UPDATE Customers</li>
        <li>SET ContactName='Juan'</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Mexico';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!</p>

    <h1>SQL DELETE Statement</h1>

    <p>The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.</p>

    <p>syntax is following:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;</p>

    <p>Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. </p>
    <p>Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. </p>
    <p>The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';</p>

    <h3>Delete All Records</h3>
    <p>It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:</p>
    
    <p>syntax is following:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM table_name;</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM Customers;</p>

    <h1>SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause</h1>

    <p>The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.</p>
    <p>The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.</strong></p>

    <p>SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>MySQL Syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition</li>
        <li>LIMIT number;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Oracle 12 Syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>ORDER BY column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>the following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):</p>

    <p>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>LIMIT 3;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):</p>
    <p>SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;</p>


    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ADD a WHERE CLAUSE</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" (for SQL Server/MS Access):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>LIMIT 3;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>the following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:</p>
    <il>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </il>

    <h1>SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions</h1>

    <p>The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.</p>
    <p>The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.</p>

    <p>min syntax is following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT MIN(column_name)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>max syntax is following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT MAX(column_name)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>min syntax example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice</li>
        <li>FROM Products; </li>
    </ul>

    <p>MAX() Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice</li>
        <li>FROM Products;</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions</h1>
    <p>The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.</p>
    <p>count syntax is following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(column_name)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column and the syntax is following</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT AVG(column_name)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column and the syntax is following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT SUM(column_name)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement finds the number of products:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(ProductID)</li>
        <li>FROM Products;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: NULL values are not counted.</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement finds the average price of all products:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT AVG(Price)</li>
        <li>FROM Products;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: NULL values are ignored.</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement finds the sum of the "Quantity" fields in the "OrderDetails" table:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT SUM(Quantity)</li>
        <li>FROM OrderDetails;</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL LIKE Operator</h1>
    <p>The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.</p>
    <p>There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters</li>
        <li>The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).</strong></p>

    <p>The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations! Like syntax is following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.</strong></p>

    <p>Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that start with "a"</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that end with "a"</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length</li>
        <li>WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName starting with "a":</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';</li>
    </ul>


    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName ending with "a":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';</li>
    </ul>


    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "or" in any position:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "r" in the second position:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>he following SQL statement selects all customers with a ContactName that starts with "a" and ends with "o":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that does NOT start with "a":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'a%';</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL Wildcards</h1>
    <p>A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.</p>
    <p><strong>Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.</strong></p>

    <p>Wildcard Characters in MS Access</p>
    <ul>
        <li>*	Represents zero or more characters	bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob</li>
        <li>?	Represents a single character	h?t finds hot, hat, and hit</li>
        <li>[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit</li>
        <li>!	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat</li>
        <li>-	Represents a range of characters	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt</li>
        <li>#	Represents any single numeric character	2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wildcard Characters in SQL Server</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>%	Represents zero or more characters	bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob</li>
        <li>_	Represents a single character	h_t finds hot, hat, and hit</li>
        <li>[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit</li>
        <li>^	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat</li>
        <li>-	Represents a range of characters	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All the wildcards can also be used in combinations!</p>
    <p>Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that starts with "a"</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that ends with "a"</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length</li>
        <li>WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using the % Wildcard</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "ber":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City containing the pattern "es": </p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City LIKE '%es%';</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using the _ Wildcard</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "ondon":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", followed by any character, followed by "on":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using the [charlist] Wildcard</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customer</li>
        <li>WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using the [!charlist] Wildcard</h3>
    <p>the two following SQL statements select all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>or</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>SQL IN Operator</h1>
    <p>The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.</p>
    <p>The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.</p>

    <p>IN Syntax is following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);</li>
    </ul>

    <p>or</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>IN Operator Examples</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers that are located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers that are NOT located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany, 'France', 'UK');</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers that are from the same countries as the suppliers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL BETWEEN Operator</h1>
    <p>The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.</p>
    <p>The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. </p>
    <p>BETWEEN syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 20:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Products</li>
        <li>WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NOT BETWEEN Example</h3>
    <p>To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Products</li>
        <li>WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>BETWEEN with IN Example</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Products</li>
        <li>WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20</li>
        <li>AND CategoryID NOT IN (1,2,3);</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>BETWEEN Text Values Example</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName between Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Products</li>
        <li>WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'</li>
        <li>ORDER BY ProductName;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName between Carnarvon Tigers and Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Products</li>
        <li>WHERE ProductName BETWEEN "Carnarvon Tigers" AND "Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning"</li>
        <li>ORDER BY ProductName;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NOT BETWEEN Text Values Example</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName not between Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Products</li>
        <li>WHERE ProductName NOT BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'</li>
        <li>ORDER BY ProductName;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>BETWEEN Dates Example</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate between '01-July-1996' and '31-July-1996':</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Orders</li>
        <li>WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/01/1996# AND #07/31/1996#;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>or</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Orders</li>
        <li>WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL Aliases</h1>
    <p>SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.</p>
    <p>Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.</p>
    <p>An alias only exists for the duration of that query.</p>
    <p>An alias is created with the AS keyword.</p>

    <p>Alias Column Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name AS alias_name</li>
        <li>FROM table_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Alias Table Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name AS alias_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Alias for Columns Examples</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer</li>
        <li>FROM Customers;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. Note: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]</li>
        <li>FROM Customers;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address</li>
        <li>FROM Customers;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: To get the SQL statement above to work in MySQL use the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address</li>
        <li>FROM Customers;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Alias for Tables Example</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). </p>
    <p>We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName</li>
        <li>FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o</li>
        <li>WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName</li>
        <li>FROM Customers, Orders</li>
        <li>WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Aliases can be useful when:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>There are more than one table involved in a query</li>
        <li>Functions are used in the query</li>
        <li>Column names are big or not very readable</li>
        <li>Two or more columns are combined together</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>SQL Joins</h1>

    <p>A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.</p>
    <p>we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate</li>
        <li>FROM Orders</li>
        <li>INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Different Types of SQL JOINs</h3>
    <p>Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables</li>
        <li>LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table</li>
        <li>RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table</li>
        <li>FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL INNER JOIN Keyword</h1>
    <p>The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table1</li>
        <li>INNER JOIN table2</li>
        <li>ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName</li>
        <li>FROM Orders</li>
        <li>INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!</strong></p>

    <h3>JOIN Three Tables</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName</li>
        <li>FROM ((Orders</li>
        <li>INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)</li>
        <li>INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword</h1>
    <p>The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table1</li>
        <li>LEFT JOIN table2</li>
        <li>ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement will select all customers, and any orders they might have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).</strong></p>

    <h1>SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword</h1>
    <p>The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table1</li>
        <li>RIGHT JOIN table2</li>
        <li>ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName</li>
        <li>FROM Orders</li>
        <li>RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).</strong></p>


    <h1>SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword</h1>
    <p>The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table1</li>
        <li>FULL OUTER JOIN table2</li>
        <li>ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.</strong></p>

    <h1>SQL Self Join</h1>

    <p>A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table1 T1, table1 T2</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City</li>
        <li>FROM Customers A, Customers B</li>
        <li>WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID</li>
        <li>AND A.City = B.City</li>
        <li>ORDER BY A.City;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong> this <>  sign is - not equal to - sign</strong></p>

    <h1>SQL UNION Operator</h1>
    <p>The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns</li>
        <li>The columns must also have similar data types</li>
        <li>The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>union syntax is following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1</li>
        <li>UNION</li>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1</li>
        <li>UNION ALL</li>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT City FROM Customers</li>
        <li>UNION</li>
        <li>SELECT City FROM Suppliers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY City;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, because UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT City FROM Customers</li>
        <li>UNION ALL</li>
        <li>SELECT City FROM Suppliers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY City;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT City, Country FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>UNION</li>
        <li>SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>ORDER BY City;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement returns the German cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT City, Country FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>UNION ALL</li>
        <li>SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>ORDER BY City;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>UNION</li>
        <li>SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country</li>
        <li>FROM Suppliers;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Notice the "AS Type" above - it is an alias. SQL Aliases are used to give a table or a column a temporary name. An alias only exists for the duration of the query. So, here we have created a temporary column named "Type", that list whether the contact person is a "Customer" or a "Supplier".</strong></p>

    <h1>SQL GROUP BY Statement</h1>
    <p>The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".</p>
    <p>The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition</li>
        <li>GROUP BY column_name(s)</li>
        <li>ORDER BY column_name(s);</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>GROUP BY Country;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>GROUP BY Country</li>
        <li>ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted low to high:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>GROUP BY Country</li>
        <li>ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) ASC;</li>
    </ul>
