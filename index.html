    <h1>SQL Tutorial</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.</p>
    <p>Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.</p>

    <!--
        SELECT * FROM Customers;
        selects all data from Data where customers are saved/

    <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.</p>

    <p>What is SQL?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language</li>
        <li>SQL lets you access and manipulate databases</li>
        <li>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What Can SQL do?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL can execute queries against a database</li>
        <li>SQL can retrieve data from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can insert records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can update records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can delete records from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create new databases</li>
        <li>SQL can create new tables in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create views in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h3>
    <p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
    <p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>

    <p>Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>

    <h3>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h3>

    <p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)</li>
        <li>To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP</li>
        <li>To use SQL to get the data you want</li>
        <li>To use HTML / CSS to style the page</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>RDBMS</h3>
    <p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.</p>
    <p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.</p>
    <p>The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.</p>

    <p>Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. </p>
    <p>A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.</p>
    <p>A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.</p>


    <h1>SQL Syntax</h1>
    <h3>Database Tables</h3>

    <p>A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data.</p>
    <p>In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database (included in MS Access and MS SQL Server).</p>
    <p>The table above contains five records (one for each customer) and seven columns (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, and Country).</p>

    <h3>SQL Statements</h3>
    <p>Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the records in the "Customers" table:</p>

    <p>SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT</p>

    <h3>Semicolon after SQL Statements?</h3>
    <p>Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.</p>
    <p>Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.</p>
