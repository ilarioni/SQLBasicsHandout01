    <h1>SQL Tutorial</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.</p>
    <p>Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.</p>

    <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.</p>

    <p>What is SQL?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language</li>
        <li>SQL lets you access and manipulate databases</li>
        <li>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What Can SQL do?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL can execute queries against a database</li>
        <li>SQL can retrieve data from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can insert records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can update records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can delete records from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create new databases</li>
        <li>SQL can create new tables in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create views in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h3>
    <p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
    <p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>

    <p>Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>

    <h3>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h3>

    <p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)</li>
        <li>To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP</li>
        <li>To use SQL to get the data you want</li>
        <li>To use HTML / CSS to style the page</li>
    </ul>
