    <h1>SQL Tutorial</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.</p>
    <p>Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.</p>

    <!--
        SELECT * FROM Customers;
        selects all data from Data where customers are saved/

    <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
    <p>SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.</p>

    <p>What is SQL?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language</li>
        <li>SQL lets you access and manipulate databases</li>
        <li>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What Can SQL do?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL can execute queries against a database</li>
        <li>SQL can retrieve data from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can insert records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can update records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can delete records from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create new databases</li>
        <li>SQL can create new tables in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create views in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h3>
    <p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
    <p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>

    <p>Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>

    <h3>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h3>

    <p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)</li>
        <li>To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP</li>
        <li>To use SQL to get the data you want</li>
        <li>To use HTML / CSS to style the page</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>RDBMS</h3>
    <p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.</p>
    <p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.</p>
    <p>The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.</p>

    <p>Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. </p>
    <p>A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.</p>
    <p>A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.</p>


    <h1>SQL Syntax</h1>
    <h3>Database Tables</h3>

    <p>A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data.</p>
    <p>In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database (included in MS Access and MS SQL Server).</p>
    <p>The table above contains five records (one for each customer) and seven columns (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, and Country).</p>

    <h3>SQL Statements</h3>
    <p>Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the records in the "Customers" table:</p>

    <p>SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT</p>

    <h3>Semicolon after SQL Statements?</h3>
    <p>Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.</p>
    <p>Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.</p>

    <h3>Some of The Most Important SQL Commands</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT - extracts data from a database</li>
        <li>UPDATE - updates data in a database</li>
        <li>DELETE - deletes data from a database</li>
        <li>INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database</li>
        <li>CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database</li>
        <li>ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database</li>
        <li>CREATE TABLE - creates a new table</li>
        <li>ALTER TABLE - modifies a table</li>
        <li>DROP TABLE - deletes a table</li>
        <li>CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)</li>
        <li>DROP INDEX - deletes an index</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL SELECT Statement</h1>
    <p>The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.</p>
    <p>The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.</p>
    <p>SELECT Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM table_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects the "CustomerName" and "City" columns from the "Customers" table:</p>
    <p>SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;</p>
    or
    <p>SELECT CustomerName,City,ContactName FROM Customers;</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the columns from the "Customers" table:</p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM Customers;</p>

    <h1>SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement</h1>
    <p>The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.</p>
    <p>Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.</p>

    <p>syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;  -- result is 21</p>
    <p>SELECT Country FROM Customers;  -- result is 91</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:</p>
    <p>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers; ---  result is 1 and 21 items inside</p>

    <p><strong>Note: The example above will not work in Firefox! Because COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) is not supported in Microsoft Access databases. Firefox is using Microsoft Access in our examples.</strong></p>

    <p>Here is the workaround for MS Access:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries</li>
        <li>FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL WHERE Clause</h1>

    <p>The WHERE clause is used to filter records.</p>
    <p>It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.</p>

    <p>WHERE Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!</strong></p>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Mexico';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>above mentioned statement selects all records where in country column there is mentioned Mexico  - 5 Records </p>

    <h3>Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields</h3>

    <p>SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).</p>
    <p>However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerID=1;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operators in The WHERE Clause</h3>
    <p>The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>=	Equal</li>
        <li>>	Greater than</li>
        <li> <span>"<"</span>	Less than</li>
        <li>>=	Greater than or equal</li>
        <li><=	Less than or equal</li>
        <li><>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=</li>
        <li>BETWEEN	Between a certain range</li>
        <li>LIKE	Search for a pattern</li>
        <li>IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators</h1>
    <p>The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.</p>

    <p>The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.</li>
        <li>The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.</p>

    <h2>AND Syntax</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>OR Syntax</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>NOT Syntax</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE NOT condition;</li>
    </ul>


    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city is "Berlin":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where city is "Berlin" OR "München":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" OR "Spain":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany' OR Country='Spain';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE NOT Country='Germany';</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Combining AND, OR and NOT</h2>
    <p>You can also combine the AND, OR and NOT operators.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city must be "Berlin" OR "München" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany" and NOT "USA":</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL ORDER BY Keyword</h1>

    <p>The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.</p>
    <p>The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2, ...</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" column:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country;</li>
    </ul>

    or

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY City;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ORDER BY DESC Example</h2>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted DESCENDING by the "Country" column:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    or 

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY CustomerID DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ORDER BY Several Columns Example</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column.</p>
    <p>This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ORDER BY Several Columns Example 2</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and descending by the "CustomerName" column:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL INSERT INTO Statement</h1>
    <p>The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.</p>

    <p>INSERT INTO Syntax</p>
    <p>it is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:</li>
        <li> If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query.
            However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement inserts a new record in the "Customers" table:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)</li>
        <li>VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway');</li>
    </ul>

    <p>customers table has one more data injected in the table</p>
    <p>Did you notice that we did not insert any number into the CustomerID field?</p>
    <p>The CustomerID column is an auto-increment field and will be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into the table.</p>

    <h3>Insert Data Only in Specified Columns</h3>
    <p>It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)</li>
        <li>VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SQL NULL Values</h1>
    <p>A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.</p>
    <p>If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field.</p>
    <p>Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!</strong></p>

    <h3>How to Test for NULL Values?</h3>
    <p>It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.</p>
    <p>We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.</p>

    <h3>IS NULL Syntax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_names</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE column_name IS NULL;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>IS NOT NULL Syntax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_names</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>The IS NULL Operator</h3>
    <p>The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).</p>
    <p>The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Address IS NULL;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.</strong></p>

    <h3>The IS NOT NULL Operator</h3>
    <p>The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).</p>
    <p>the following SQL lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address</li>
        <li>FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>it gives filled data back</strong></p>


    <h1>The SQL UPDATE Statement</h1>

    <p>The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.</p>
    <p>UPDATE Syntax</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UPDATE table_name</li>
        <li>SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement.</p>
    <p>The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!</p>

    <p>example</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UPDATE Customers</li>
        <li>SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt'</li>
        <li>WHERE CustomerID=1;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>UPDATE Multiple Records</h3>

    <p>It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.</p>
    <p>The following SQL statement will update the ContactName to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":</p>

    <ul>
        <li>UPDATE Customers</li>
        <li>SET ContactName='Juan'</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Mexico';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!</p>

    <h1>SQL DELETE Statement</h1>

    <p>The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.</p>

    <p>syntax is following:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;</p>

    <p>Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. </p>
    <p>Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. </p>
    <p>The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';</p>

    <h3>Delete All Records</h3>
    <p>It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:</p>
    
    <p>syntax is following:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM table_name;</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:</p>
    <p>DELETE FROM Customers;</p>

    <h1>SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause</h1>

    <p>The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.</p>
    <p>The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.</strong></p>

    <p>SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>MySQL Syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>WHERE condition</li>
        <li>LIMIT number;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Oracle 12 Syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FROM table_name</li>
        <li>ORDER BY column_name(s)</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>the following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):</p>

    <p>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;</p>

    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>LIMIT 3;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):</p>
    <p>SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;</p>


    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ADD a WHERE CLAUSE</h3>
    <p>The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" (for SQL Server/MS Access):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany';</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>LIMIT 3;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>the following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:</p>
    <il>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers</li>
        <li>WHERE Country='Germany'</li>
        <li>FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;</li>
    </il>
